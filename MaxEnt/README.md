# RSFSA_R/MaxEnt: R code for Random Subset Feature Selection Algorithm with MaxEnt Niche Model from Tracy et al. (2018, submitted)

A Fire Vignette R program (RSFSA_MaxEnt_R_LoBrnFireData.R in RCode/FireVignette folder) and associated functions (in RCode/Functions folder) and csv data (in FireVignetteData folder) are provided for running the first part of the program without needing the 
90 North American environmental rasters at 1 km resolution. This first part of the program serves to demonstrate the random subset feature selection algorithm with MaxEnt. The last part of the program invovles projecting MaxEnt models and would require environmental rasters not provided. Some instructions and comments are provided at the beginning and throughout the vignette program. The Fire Vignette R program is set up to run provided Low Burn Severity csv files (11), but it can be modified to run the provided 11 csv files each for Moderate and High Burn Severities.
