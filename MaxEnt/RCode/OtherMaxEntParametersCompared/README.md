# RSFSA_R/MaxEnt: R code for Random Subset Feature Selection Algorithm with Glmnet Niche Model from Tracy et al. (2018, submitted)

These programs are designed for comparison with earlier MaxEnt output (vignette program output) by using training data and random subsets generated with a MaxEnt version of the program (can be modified to generate its own data).
